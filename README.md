# About

[![License][license-badge]][license]
After deploying several Windows Virtual Desktop environments I decided I no longer wanted to manually download the Admx files I needed, and I wanted a way to keep them up-to-date.

This script solves both problems.
* Checks for newer versions of the Admx files that are present and processes the new version if found
* Optionally copies the new Admx files to the Policy Store or Definition folder, or a folder of your chosing

The name I chose for this script is an ode to the Evergreen module (https://github.com/aaronparker/Evergreen) by Aaron Parker (@stealthpuppy).
